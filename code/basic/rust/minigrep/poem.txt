Life full of confusing and dordering Particular time, 
a particular location, 
Do the arranged thing of ten million time in the brain, 
Step by step , 
the life hard to avoid delicacy and stiffness No enthusiasm forever, 
No unexpected happening of surpring and pleasing So, 
only silently ask myself in mind Next happiness, 
when will come?
